- Use functional components with React.FC and well-typed props
- Define props interface above the component implementation
- Always default export at bottom of file
- Use Radix UI, Tailwind, and avoid using MUI
- Use Next Router for navigation
- Always include loading/error state handling
- Prefer minimal, readable JSX; break large components into smaller ones
- Use Toasts for notifications: React Toastify and Radix Toast
